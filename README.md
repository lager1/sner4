## 1 Project description

The main goal of this project is to create software suite for:

1. Distribution of network reconnaissance workload
	* Scanning/reconnaissance is performed by set of modular agents. Each
	  agent module wraps one existing or implements new tool such as nmap,
          nikto, sslscan.
	* Agent architecture allows to do pivoted scans and elastic scan
	  scheduling.

2. Data analysis and management
	* Flexible user-interface allows to analyze monitored infrastructure
	  and manage information on on-demand and continuous basis
	* Programmatical access to the data through standard ORM interface to
	  provide further analysis capabilities


### 1.1 Design overview

The application is divided into several components according to theirs main
functions. The *reconnaissance* part gathers standard data produced by scanning
tools, while *data management* part focuses on data analysis and management.

## 2 Features

### 2.1 Common features

User web interface uses cookie based session management with username+password
w/o OTP or FIDO2 Webauthn password-less authentication. REST API used by agents
uses header-based apikey authentication. Role-based authorization is applied on
web application request routing level.

Default Flask session implementation has been replaced with custom session
server-side file based storage. 

Various components provides limited command-line interface through `server`
command. Flask shell can be used to access the ORM model directly for advanced
analysis or out-of-interface data management.


### 2.2 Reconnaissance subsystem

#### Agent

Agent wraps an existing tools with the communication (agent) and execution
layer (modules). Generally, the agent instance draws assignment from server,
performs the task, marshalls output and delivers it to the server. Agent
provides several modes of execution (default, one-time execution, handling
specific queue) and main module provides functions for process handling
(shutdown after task, immediate termination).

All requests from agent must be authenticated with apikey for user account in
role *agent*. Key can be specified in configuration file or by command-line
switch.

Currently available modules are: dummy (testing), nmap (IP address scanning or
service sweep scanning), manymap (specific service scanning). 


#### Server: Scheduler

Scheduler provides workload configuration and distribution mechanism throug
definitions of Tasks, Queues, Exclusions and Jobs.

* **Task** -- a module configuration executed by agent.

* **Queue** -- list of targets and scheduling specification (active, group_size,
  priority) for linked Task. Every module has different target
  specification, see corresponding module implementation docstrings for
  details.

* **Excl** (exclusion) -- CIDR or regex targets exclusion specifications. During
  continuous recons, some parts of monitored networks must be avoided for
  policy, operations or security reasons. Exclusions are used during the
  assignment phase (not enqueue phase) because exclusion list might change
  between time of queue setup and target selection, scheduler silently discards
  all targets matching any configured exclusion during assignment creation
  process.

* **Job** -- one assignment/job for the agent. JSON data and ZIP archive containing
  input for agent/module and it's corresponding output parseable by *Data
  management* (Storage) subsystem.

CLI helpers are available for IP ranges enumerations and queues/targets
management.



### 2.3 Data management subsystem

#### Server: Storage and Parsers

Storage is a main IP-centric database model and user interface heavily inspired
by Metasploit framework PRO UI.

Web interface allows for CRUD operations on all models, filtering of list
views, grouping of vulnerabilities and services by properties, basic condensed
report datasheet generation (FLAB specific feature).

Parsers are used to import agent output data (zip archives) produced by
modules. See the `server storage import` for help. Parsers can also import
default output formats of various security tools and scanners (currently: nmap,
nessus).


#### Server: Visuals

Visualization modules can be used to get insight about current storage data:

* DNS tree
* Portmap explorer
* (Service) Port infos


#### Server: Planner

**Not implemented**

Planner component will take care of periodic queueing of existing or new
targets to refresh information in storage.

## 4 Usage

### 4.1 Reconnaissance scenario

1. Select existing or define new task: *scheduler > tasks > add | edit*
2. Select existing or define new queue: *scheduler > queues > add | edit*
3. Generate target list
	* manualy
	* from cidr: `bin/server scheduler enumips 127.0.0.0/24 > targets`
	* from network range: `bin/server scheduler rangetocidr 127.0.0.1 127.0.3.5 | bin/server scheduler enumips --file=- > targets`
4. Setup exclusions (*scheduler > exclusions > add | edit*)
5. Enqueue targets
	* web: *scheduler > queues > [queue] > enqueue*
	* cli: `bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue [queue_id | queue_ident] --file=targets`
6. Run the agent `bin/agent &` (TODO: screen or systemd service)
7. Monitor the queue until all jobs has been finished by agent
8. Stop the agent `bin/agent --shutdown [PID]`
9. Recon data can be found in queue directories (`[SNER_VAR]/scheduler/[queue.id]`)


### 4.2 Data evaluation scenario

1. Import existing data with one of the available parsers: `bin/server storage import [parser name] [filename]`
2. Use web interface to consult the data: *storage > hosts | services | vulns | notes | ...*
3. Manage data in storage
	* use CRUD, comments or tags to sort the data out
	* use server shell for advanced analysis
4. Generate preliminary vulnerability report: *storage > vulns > Generate report*


### 4.3 Examples

#### Use-case: Basic dns recon

```
bin/server scheduler enumips 192.0.2.0/24 | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'dns_recon.main' --file=-
bin/agent --debug --queue 'dns recon'
```

#### Use-case: Long-term scanning strategy

Import gathered data after each step.

1. Service discovery, TCP ACK scan to search for alive hosts and probable services (avoids some flow based IDS/IPS systems).

    ```
    bin/server scheduler enumips 192.168.0.0/16 \
        | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'sner_011 top10000 ack scan.main' --file=-
    ```

2. Service fingerprinting, use lower intensity for first wave, scan most common services first, avoid tcp/22 with regex exclusion on `^tcp://.*:22$`.

    ```
    # fast track
    bin/server storage service-list --filter 'Service.port in [21,80,179,443,1723,3128,8000,8080,8443]' \
        | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'sner_020 inet version scan basic.prio' --file=-
    # rest of the ports
    bin/server storage service-list --filter 'Service.port not_in [21,80,179,443,1723,3128,8000,8080,8443]' \
        | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'sner_020 inet version scan basic.main' --file=-
    ```

3. Re-queue services without identification for high intensity version scan.

    ```
    bin/server storage service-list --filter 'Service.state ilike "open%" AND (Service.info == "" OR Service.info is_null "")' \
        | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'sner_025 inet version scan intense.main' --file=-
    ```

4. Cleanup storage, remove services in filtered state (ack scan artifacts) and prune hosts without any data

    ```
    bin/server storage service-cleanup
    bin/server storage host-cleanup
    ```

5. ?Fully rescan alive hosts


#### Use-case: Service specific scanning

##### Automated (module manymap)

```
# ftp sweep
bin/server storage service-list --filter 'Service.state ilike "open%" AND Service.name == "ftp"' \
    | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'sner_030 ftp sweep.main' --file=-

# http titles
bin/server storage service-list --filter 'Service.state ilike "open%" AND Service.name ilike "http%"' \
    | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'sner_031 http titles.main' --file=-

# ldap info
bin/server storage service-list --filter 'Service.state ilike "open%" AND Service.name == "ldap"' \
    | bin/server scheduler queue-enqueue 'sner_032 ldap rootdse.main' --file=-
```

##### Manual

Generally pure nmap can be used to do specific sweeps/scanning.

```
# template
nmap SCANTYPE TIMING(-Pn --reason --scan-delay 10 --max-rate 1 --max-hostgroup 1) TARGETING OUTPUT(-oA output)

# example
bin/server storage service-list --filter 'Service.port == 22' --iponly > targets
nmap \
    -sV --version-intensity 4 \
    -Pn --reason --scan-delay 10 --max-rate 1 --max-hostgroup 1 \
    -p T:22 -iL targets \
    -oA output
bin/server storage import nmap output.xml
```


#### Use-case: Shell interface

Flask shell (pre-loaded with sner models) is available for scripting and
programmatic manipulation with all objects.

```
$ bin/server shell
>>> webservices = Service.query.filter(Service.proto=='tcp', Service.port.in_([80, 443, 8080, 8443])).all()
>>> for tmp in webservices:
...   print('%s:%s' % (tmp.host.address, tmp.port))
```



## 5 Development

* Server is Flask based application with heavy usage of DataTable and
  Handlebars. Agent is an standalone python module. See `.travis.yml` to get
  started.

* Project uses flake8, pylint, pytest, coverage, selenium and travis-ci.org to
  ensure functionality and coding standards.

* Any review or contribution is welcome.
